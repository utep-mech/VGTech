Dynamic Learning Framework (DLF) for Personalized Intervention Strategies

#Covid-19 Impact: A small contribution from our side to the people (esp so many teachers and students around the world) impacted by the pandemic

We have decided to make the Dynamic Learning Framework (DLF) software public with a hope that many teachers and instructors or developers may find it useful post/during covid-19. Online "only" teaching due to Covid-19 pandemic health crisis, real student-teacher engagement (perhaps a very important aspect for mathematically and geometrically rich subjects (e.g. Statics/Fluid Mechanics for Engineering students or Science/Math classes for K-12 students)  has taken a big toll which will have an impact on students' learning outcomes. We have been working for increasing the engagment in hybrind online-classroom settings (for 10+ years) and have purposefully designed/created tools to increase student-teacher engagement in online settings through micro-assessment (e.g. RAT - Rapid Assessment Tests). 

DLF is an education software/framework (mostly written in PHP, Javascript, & HTML5 with significant use of opensource libraries), has been in development 10+ years with a focus on providing intuitive and engaging learning and assessment materials thatâ€™re seamlessly integrated across K-16 class boundaries and make them make accessible and useful forall through user-friendly interfaces. 

Our mantra is leverage evidence based pedagogies & data-driven tools to re-imagine personalized learning and strategically implant learning interventions via leading-edge computing and computational infrastructures.
