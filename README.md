# VGTech (Vyaktigat Gyan Tech or Personalized Learning Tech)
A Dynamic Learning Framework (DLF) for Personalized Learning Interventions 

# Covid-19 Impact: 
A small contribution from our side to the people (esp for so many teachers and students around the world) impacted by the pandemic

We have decided to make the Dynamic Learning Framework (DLF) software public with a hope that many teachers and instructors or developers may find it useful post/during covid-19. Online "only" teaching due to Covid-19 pandemic health crisis, real student-teacher engagement (perhaps a very important aspect for mathematically and geometrically rich subjects (e.g. Statics/Fluid Mechanics for Engineering students or Science/Math classes for K-12 students)  has taken a big toll which will have an impact on students' learning outcomes. We have been working for increasing the engagment in hybrind online-classroom settings (for 10+ years) and have purposefully designed/created tools to increase student-teacher engagement in online settings through micro-assessment (e.g. RAT - Rapid Assessment Tests). 

DLF is an education software/framework (mostly written in PHP, Javascript, & HTML5 with significant use of opensource libraries), has been in development ~10 years. Our aim is on providing intuitive and engaging learning and assessment framework thatâ€™re seamlessly integrated across K-16 class boundaries and make them make accessible and useful forall through user-friendly interfaces. 

Our mantra is leverage evidence based pedagogies & data-driven tools to re-imagine personalized learning and strategically implant learning interventions via leading-edge computing and computational infrastructures.

# How to get started? 
1) Installation (use git to clone or download as zip)
git clone https://github.com/utep-mech/VGTech.git 
2) Install webserver (Apache) & PHP). May want to install mongodb server (still in testing). 
3) Dependencies/third party libraries used
firebase (http://firebase.google.com/), ckeditor (https://ckeditor.com/), MathJAX
4) edit setup.php in 'public_html' to point the directory to right locations. Give write permission to the data director. The directory 'public_html' should point to the webserver's main public folder.
5) run the webserver and visit the site.

# To do list
- add real time database for real time engagement
- add sketching tools in various categories
- create intuitive interfaces
- integrate engineering simulation softwares
- integrate ML features to streamline/automate repetitive tasks

# Acknowledgement  
The core components were mostly developed by Prof. V. Kumar but several faculty, students, and staff contributed to the project. In particular, we would like to thank Profs V. Tandon & Tarquin (UTEP) and Prof S. Kumar (UTB, not at IITK). We would also like to thank several graduate/UG students and staff from Prof. Kumar group particularly Dr. Kotteda (UTEP, U. Wyoming), Jesus Ortega (Sandia), Ashesh, Arturo 1&2, Paul (Sandia), Samia Afrin (Univ E. Tennesse), Emilio, and many others. 

We would like to sincerely thank several funding agencies esp IBM (2011 Smarter Planet Faculty Innovation Award - the first grant which in fact helped start this project, UTEP Provost office (Engaging with Assessment grant - thank to Toni Blum) and many federal agencies (particularly the Dept of Energy and Dept of Defense, DOE Labs - Sandia/ORNL/NETL/NREL, AFRL - RDSM/HAFB) for supporting our advanced modeling and simulations research activities which is indirectly helping develop and integrate the engineering software with DLF. 


# Note (Dr. Kumar)
For about a month or so, I've been tirelessly trying to clean the codes, certainly at some big personal cost but hopefully it was a good use of covid-19 lockdown situation! The codes are still a very academic (with almost no documentation, sorry but working on it!) but I thought to get it out anyway in case anyone wants to try during/post Covid-19 period. We're still trying to fix some glitches. Let me know (vkumar@utep.edu) if you want try/use it but are facing problems.
